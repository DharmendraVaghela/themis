    Collate system answer confidences and annotator judgments by question/answer pair.
    Add to each pair the question frequency.

    Though you expect the set of question/answer pairs in the system answers and judgments to not be disjoint, it may
    be the case that neither is a subset of the other. If annotation is incomplete, there may be Q/A pairs in the
    system answers that haven't been annotated yet. If multiple systems are being judged, there may be Q/A pairs in the
    judgements that don't appear in the system answers.

    Some versions of Annotation Assist strip newlines from the answers they return in the judgement files, so
    optionally take this into account when joining on question/answer pairs.
